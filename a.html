On the bank of the river,a white-haired old man was sitting on a big rock,holding a long fishing rod. His posture was calm,his expression focused and deep., The end of the fishing rod,hanging a straight hook,no bait. This old man is Jiang Taigong. He is not really fishing,but waiting for someone who can understand his wisdom and ambition. His eyes revealed a kind of detachment and wisdom,as if to say: "I am here,waiting for the person who can recognize me.", Surrounded by lush trees,in the distance are rolling mountains,and a few leisurely white clouds float in the sky. Occasionally a few birds skimmed over the water,breaking the tranquility of the surface. Jiang Taigong's figure is integrated with the surrounding natural scenery,which is particularly harmonious., At this time,a gorgeously dressed aristocrat-Wen Wang Ji Chang-passed by here,he was attracted by Jiang Taigong's unique way of fishing. He stopped and watched the old man curiously. Jiang Taigong looked up,the two eyes met,and a dialogue about wisdom and ambition was about to begin., This picture not only shows Jiang Taigong's otherworldly and patient waiting,but also heralds the beginning of a legendary story. It conveys a kind of artistic conception of tranquility and wisdom waiting,and makes people feel a kind of wisdom and power beyond time and space.,</p>
